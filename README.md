# **MyBank Database SQL Queries**

## **Project Overview**

This project demonstrates the design and analysis of a banking database (`mybank`) using SQL. It includes queries to manage and analyze customers, accounts, transactions, loans, credit cards, branches, and ATMs.

The SQL scripts focus on **data management, aggregation, and insights** for a typical banking system.
